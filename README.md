This repository will serve as documentation for my self-hosted services, it is not intended as a guide for other users, but feel free to use it as a template if you find it useful. You can find some actual guides on my [blog](https://www.fuzzygrim.com/), I have posts on how to host a media server, how to safely expose services to the internet and more.
